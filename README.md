# Prototype 0.03
I fixed the MIME type error. quick explanation: MIME type refers to a file type, the browser was expecting a css file, but could not find one and resorted to the html file which threw an error for the browser's strict MIME type matching. The browser could not find one because I had a typo in the reference to the css file, or rather I had a typo in the css file's name, i changed the name to styles to match the reference i had down and what the ai agent im working with thinks its called.
